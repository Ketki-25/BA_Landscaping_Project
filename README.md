# Landscaping & Snow Removal Business – Power BI Dashboard

### 🌿 Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes a **AI-created simulated dataset** representing operations of a landscaping and snow removal business.  
It is my **first Business Analysis (BA) project** showing how to transform operational job records into clear, actionable insights using visualization and data storytelling.

The goal: Demonstrate the full data analysis lifecycle from dataset design and cleaning to dashboard design and business interpretation.
